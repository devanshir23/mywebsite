        <p><strong>Purvanshi</strong> is a master in the fitness world, specializing in calisthenics. With years of experience and a confident command over her field, even her simplest workout videos radiate strength and precision. She had a clear sense of direction when it came to fitness, but the main goal was to translate that clarity into content that truly resonated with people. My role was to bring her knowledge out in a way that felt approachable, relatable, and impactful—so her audience could understand her as easily as possible, without feeling overwhelmed. Together, we created content that matched her energy and helped her connect with viewers more meaningfully.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The journey was smoother due to her strong personal network, which brought in consistent engagement.</li>
          <li>One challenge was experimenting with various content types—some formats worked well immediately, while others needed testing and refining.</li>
          <li>Another key challenge was ensuring her content didn’t feel overwhelming; she wanted to make fitness accessible and easy to digest for everyone.</li>
          <li>We focused on simplifying complex ideas and presenting them in a relatable, engaging way.</li>

      </div>
      <div class="text-block">
        <ul>
          <li>We experimented with both long-form and short-form Reels.</li>
          <li>Short-form Reels featured exercise breakdowns using clear typography and upbeat music to keep it crisp and engaging.</li>
          <li>Long-form Reels had voice-over storytelling, where Purvanshi explained concepts, shared her fitness journey, and gave valuable advice.</li>
          <li>We also placed her in front of the camera, letting her speak directly to the audience—this personal touch worked really well.</li>
          <li>B-rolls were used effectively to enhance storytelling and bring depth to the message.</li>
          <li>Carousels weren’t a focus since Reels were showing better growth and engagement during this phase.</li>
