        <p><strong>Yoga Vritti: Where wellness meets wisdom.</strong><br><br>
        Yoga Vritti is more than just an online yoga class—it’s a personal, soul-soothing space founded by a certified teacher with a mission to help people connect with yoga for their emotional, mental, and physical well-being.<br><br>
        From naming the class to shaping its voice and suggesting the brand colors, I was deeply involved in building Yoga Vritti’s identity from the ground up. The goal? To make it feel approachable, intentional, and truly inspiring.</p>

    <h2>2. Challenges</h2>
    <div class="media-block reverse">
      <div class="media">
        <img src="D:/New website content/CY.png" alt="Challenges Yogavritti" />
      </div>
      <div class="text-block">
        <ul>
          <li>We were starting from scratch—no personal brand, no past presence.</li>
          <li>The founder redirected her own network to help build the base, and it worked surprisingly well.</li>
          <li>The online yoga space is crowded, so standing out was a real task.</li>
          <li>Consistency and building a steady online presence took time, effort, and a whole lot of patience.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>3. Branding & Visual Identity</h2>
    <div class="media-block">
      <div class="media">
        <img src="D:/New website content/branding.png" alt="Branding" />
      </div>
      <div class="text-block">
        <p>To reflect the calm and grounding nature of yoga, I built the brand identity around shades of blue—think ocean vibes. Soothing, deep, and emotionally grounding.<br><br>
        The copy direction followed the same energy. The line “Find your inner balance from anywhere” became the heart of it—because the founder couldn’t take offline classes and needed the flexibility of global access.<br><br>
        The logo carried an attractive, peaceful element that felt inviting yet rooted in the purpose of the brand.</p>

    <h2>4. Content Strategy</h2>
    <div class="media-block reverse">
      <div class="media">
        <img src="D:/New website content/static.png" alt="Content Strategy" />
      </div>
      <div class="text-block">
        <p>Short-form reels were the real MVP—sometimes just 10 seconds long, using only typography to guide viewers through a step-by-step yoga flow.<br><br>
        We also experimented with slightly longer reels where the founder spoke directly, explaining concepts and building connection.<br><br>
        Both formats brought in different types of engagement, and we leaned into what worked best for each topic.<br><br>
        Alongside reels, we made carousels that weren’t just pretty—they were clever. One post said, “Roll out your mat. Not your commute.” That’s the kind of energy we brought in: creative, clear, and completely on-brand.</p>

    <h2>5. Content Production & Consistency</h2>
    <div class="media-block">
      <div class="media">
        <img src="D:/New website content/consitency.png" alt="Content Consistency" />
      </div>
      <div class="text-block">
        <p>Every reel cover followed the brand’s visual tone, ocean blues and soft whites—to keep things soothing, clean, and instantly recognizable.<br><br>
        The content wasn’t random. It was backed by authentic research, thanks to the founder’s clarity on what she wanted to share.<br><br>
        My role? Bringing that knowledge to life through thoughtful ideation and engaging edits that didn’t just look good—they felt good.<br><br>
        The result? Consistent content that slowly but surely built a meaningful online presence—organically, and with intention.</p>
